# Simian Photo Server
Simian photo server (SPS from now on) is a self-hosted photograph organizer. It started as something to do in the two weeks I had between leaving one job and starting another. That first version is saved in the git tag "as-blogged-in-aug-2016". As you might imagine the first version was a little rough around the edges even though it worked. So I'm rewriting SPS in my free time.

At the moment the current version is not usable, but that will change in near future.
